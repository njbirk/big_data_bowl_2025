Load in the tracking data and any necessary libraries.

```{R, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

tracking = read.csv("../data/tracking_week_1.csv")
```

## Player Maxes

First we need a way to determine the maximum speed and acceleration a player is capable of reaching. Let's first look at a defensive back.

**Name**: Troy Hill

**NFLID**: 42816

```{R}
# get only Troy Hill's frames
troy_hill <- tracking %>% filter(nflId == 42816)

hist(troy_hill$s, breaks=30)
max(troy_hill$a)
head(troy_hill[,c("s", "a")], 100)
```
