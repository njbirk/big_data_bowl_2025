Starting research question: how good is WR motion at predicting man vs. zone?

Next steps:

- Determine start/end time for each motion
    - Time series for each motioning receiver-look for changes in speed, acceleration, distance
- After we identify time of motion, look for defender covering that time
- Look for any patterns in coverage during motion
- Can also include safeties and LBs in analysis

From there we can ask more specific questions including

- Does the QB use the gained info from the motion?
- Are certain types of motion more effective?
- What teams hide coverage adjustments the best?
